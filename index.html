    I am a computer engineering student from Palestine, currently in my second year at Birzeit University. 
    I am 20 years old and originally from Tulkarem. 
    This project marks my first venture into this field, and I am excited to learn and grow as I work on it. 
    My journey as a student has been a rewarding one, as I've had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of computer engineering,
     expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. 
     I look forward to the challenges and experiences that lie ahead as I continue to pursue my passion for technology and innovation.
